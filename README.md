# ROBINHOOD

## ABOUT

### Overview
RobinHood is an investment application co-founded by Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev in 2013. The company emerged to provide commission free trading in stocks, cryptocurrencies, options and ETFs. They provide these services on an application that can be accessed via a computer or a mobile phone and thus are a part of the robo-advisors domain in FinTech. Their Gold subscription is as low as “$6 per month” and so they encourage future investors to gain advice and trade with minimal to no commission. 

### Idea
The co-founders Bhatt and Tenev met during their years at Stanford University and then worked together in New York to build trading softwares for hedge funds. Later they realized the need of having a firm that allows everyone to access the financial markets and not just the wealthy. Therefore, the name "RobinHood". 


### Funding
RobinHood makes its profit mainly by charging a fee on stock lending. Stock lending allows the businesses to gain profits because a short sale is processed only when relevant shares are borrowed. So here, RobinHood provides its customers a credit to buy securities and thus earning a profit on the credit fees. As of August 2020, RobinHood announced it raised $200 million funding from a new investor, currently valuing the company at $11.2 billion. This is majorly credited to a whopping increase in their users from last year to this year, i.e. doubled to around 6 million users.

### Customers
Unlike RobinHood’s more established competitors like Schwab, E-Trade or Fidelity, it attracts its customers via easy to use mobile application and no minimum deposit. This makes their target audience to be Millennials, which have been the demographic which is not targeted by the usual investing companies. Even the data shows, 80% of RobinHood’s customers are Millennials with an average age of 26.

### Impact
One of the most famous application of internet in the 90s was on-line trading and RobinHood has single-handedly displayed dot-com disruption. Even though the other, more established, online-trading companies are around, RobinHood has made a place for itself and has proved that it is here to stay. 

It displays as the perfect example for how the usual commission-based competitors like Schwab and Fidelity can be disrupted. Their almost no-fee-structure also demonstrates the efficiency as well as cost saving techniques that the internet or the FinTech environment provides. 


### Metrics

### Relative Performance
Co-founder Baiju Bhatt’s vision was that “They’re going to be the Amazon of financial services” and indeed their growth follows the pattern. RobinHood’s growth has been enormous in just a short period of time. Its funding has been increases multifold but also it has more customers than much more established competitors such as E-Trade Financial which has been around since 1982.
