# ROBINHOOD

## ABOUT

### Overview
RobinHood is an investment application co-founded by Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev in 2013. The company emerged to provide commission free trading in stocks, cryptocurrencies, options and ETFs. They provide these services on an application that can be accessed via a computer or a mobile phone and thus are a part of the robo-advisors domain in FinTech. Their Gold subscription is as low as “$6 per month” and so they encourage future investors to gain advice and trade with minimal to no commission. 

### Idea

### Funding
RobinHood makes its profit mainly by charging a fee on stock lending. Stock lending allows the businesses to gain profits because a short sale is processed only when relevant shares are borrowed. So here, RobinHood provides its customers a credit to buy securities and thus earning a profit on the credit fees. In May 2019, through the reports by Bloomberg, RobinHood entered the $7-10 billion range which has only grown in 2020. This is majorly credited to a whopping increase in their users from last year to this year, i.e. doubled to around 6 million users.
