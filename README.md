# ROBINHOOD

## ABOUT

### Overview
RobinHood is an investment application co-founded by Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev in 2013. The company emerged to provide commission free trading in stocks, cryptocurrencies, options and ETFs. They provide these services on an application that can be accessed via a computer or a mobile phone and thus are a part of the robo-advisors domain in FinTech. Their Gold subscription is as low as “$6 per month” and so they encourage future investors to gain advice and trade with minimal to no commission. 

### Idea
The co-founders Bhatt and Tenev met during their years at Stanford University and then worked together in New York to build trading softwares for hedge funds. Later they realized the need of having a firm that allows everyone to access the financial markets and not just the wealthy. Therefore, the name "RobinHood". 

### Funding
RobinHood makes its profit mainly by charging a fee on stock lending. Stock lending allows the businesses to gain profits because a short sale is processed only when relevant shares are borrowed. So here, RobinHood provides its customers a credit to buy securities and thus earning a profit on the credit fees. As of August 2020, RobinHood announced it raised $200 million funding from a new investor, currently valuing the company at $11.2 billion. This is majorly credited to a whopping increase in their users from last year to this year, i.e. doubled to around 6 million users.  

## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES:

### Financial Problems Solving
RobinHood’s aim is to make it easy for a new investor to understand the regulations, financial assets and the market. It makes it accessible not only in terms of making it easy but also by “lowering barriers, removing fees and providing greater access to financial information”. They want the common people of America to have the option of wealth creation by using best possible investment tools. As the co-founders spent their initial years at the Wall Street, they realized that the market lacks investment opportunities for the commoners as well as the young people and thus ventured to solve that problem. 

### Customers
Unlike RobinHood’s more established competitors like Schwab, E-Trade or Fidelity, it attracts its customers via easy to use mobile application and no minimum deposit. This makes their target audience to be Millennials, which have been the demographic which is not targeted by the usual investing companies. Even the data shows, 80% of RobinHood’s customers are Millennials with an average age of 26. 

### Technologies


## LANDSCAPE:
RobinHood is part of the robo-advising domain of FinTech. Robo-advising uses mathematical algorithms to provide financial advising and at a lower cost as there is no human interaction. These algorithms use the information entered by the individuals and process it to give the best option for them. Th industry is growth at a rapid rate. By 2020, $3.7 trillion in assets are expected to be managed by robo-advisors and it is only expected to grow almost by 5 times to reach $16 trillion by 2025, based on reports.  

Robo-advising focuses on especially targeting millennials, who are tech savvy, and new to investment, get financial advising in low fees and thus getting them introduced to investment. They aim to maintain millennial’s trust in technology and computers by removing the distrust on the banking industry that could have developed over years due to major financial downturns. However, data shows that most of the millennials rely on a face-to-face advisor and cannot solely rely on technology. Even though robo-advising is still in its nascent stage, they are still maximizing their market share by providing low cost investment advising.  However, soon they will need more individualized, traditional, blended provision of advisory as people start realizing the cost-benefit of using robo-advisory. They are expected to innovate more so that each need can be met not in just a robotic manner but keeping the individual needs in mind. 

RobinHood has a number of competitors in their domain. Companies like Schwab and Fidelity are increasingly using these algorithms but also providing human advising with is an added benefit to them. In terms of cryptocurrency, CoinBase is one of the more established players from where RobinHood can face direct competition. 

## RESULTS:

### Impact
One of the most famous application of internet in the 90s was on-line trading and RobinHood has single-handedly displayed dot-com disruption. Even though the other, more established, online-trading companies are around, RobinHood has made a place for itself and has proved that it is here to stay. 

It displays as the perfect example for how the usual commission-based competitors like Schwab and Fidelity can be disrupted. Their almost no-fee-structure also demonstrates the efficiency as well as cost saving techniques that the internet or the FinTech environment provides. 


### Metrics

### Relative Performance
Co-founder Baiju Bhatt’s vision was that “They’re going to be the Amazon of financial services” and indeed their growth follows the pattern. RobinHood’s growth has been enormous in just a short period of time. Its funding has been increases multifold but also it has more customers than much more established competitors such as E-Trade Financial which has been around since 1982.
