# ROBINHOOD

## About

### Overview
RobinHood is an investment application co-founded by Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev in 2013. The company emerged to provide commission free trading in stocks, cryptocurrencies, options and ETFs. They provide these services on an application that can be accessed via a computer or a mobile phone and thus are a part of the robo-advisors domain in FinTech. Their Gold subscription is as low as “$6 per month” and so they encourage future investors to gain advice and trade with minimal to no commission.
